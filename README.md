# Timeseries-3d Demo Application

## Install and Run

```
make install build start
```

This will `install` all the dependencies, `build` the front-end (webpack) and `start` the Flask application hosting the app.

Manually this will do:

```bash
# install
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
npm install
# build
npm run build
# start
python3 runner.py
```
